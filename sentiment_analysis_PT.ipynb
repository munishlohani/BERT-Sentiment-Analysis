After coming here, makes sense why it wasn't memorable. It's definitely a tourist spot and I was expecting a more exciting menu. Their menu is pretty limited food wise and pricey for what they serve. All they really serve is burgers and chicken sandwiches with maybe 5 other entrees to pick from. My coworker and I decided to go to Pier 39 after a work conference. We ate at the restaurant around 5:30 on a Thursday and we were seated right away. The place wasn't too busy, one large group and maybe 5 or 6 other tables were full. There was a live DJ playing. <br/><br/>I ordered their Mac and cheese and my friend got a burger. We also got the onion ring tower and I ordered their signature hurricane with the souvenir glass for $5 more and you also get 8 oz more of the beverage. The Mac and cheese was ok, it had a strong red bell pepper flavor to it. The burger was good but the fries were bland. Our favorite item was the onion rings. They came out piping hot and crispy. The hurricane was tasty, definitely my type of tropical flavors. <br/><br/>Overall it was alright, not a place I'd choose to go to again even if I were to bring people from out of town into the Bay. There's better options for food even for tourist spots. The restaurant was clean and service was fine.</span></p>,\n",

If you're looking for a great meal with wonderful atmophere, Hard Rock Cafe can't be beat.  Yes, it's a must visit.<br/><br/>One reason that I chose to eat here was because I didn't want to go to the other restaurant.  The other place was Bubba Gump's which was at the end of the pier.  The other reason was because I am a AAA member and this was on the list.  By the way, both are on the list.<br/><br/>I ordered the Legendary Burger which when it arrived was larger than it was display on the menu.  Very good and messy.  It definitely came out as I ordered it.  It came with French fries, but I was already too full.<br/><br/>The service by Juliesca was excellent.  Very friendly and pretty much was the only waitress around.  It was not packed on an early Sunday afternoon.<br/><br/>I would return the next time that I am back in the city.</span></p>,\n",

My family and I had a wonderful time here, and we couldn't stop raving about the food. The Messi burger was a standout - juicy, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. But it wasn't just the burgers that impressed us - all of our entrees were delicious and satisfying, with generous portions that left us feeling full and happy.<br/><br/>But it's not just about the food at Hard Rock Cafe. The lively atmosphere and music memorabilia add to the overall experience, making this a fun spot for families and kids. We loved checking out the guitars, gold records, and other rock 'n' roll artifacts while enjoying our meal. And the service was excellent too - our server was friendly, attentive, and made sure we had everything we needed.<br/><br/>Overall, we highly recommend the Hard Rock Cafe in San Francisco. It's a great spot for a meal, whether you're a music fan or just looking for a fun dining experience. We'll definitely be back!</span></p>,\n",

We had made a reservation for four on the app and were sat right away by the friendly hostess. The place is cool and mellow. Always something to look at. <br/><br/>We had Donna as are server. She was great and funny. Full of great info and very accommodating with several special adjustments for a vegetarian and a picky kid. <br/><br/>They have a big bar area if you want to just swing in for a drink and check it out.<br/><br/>The onion rings were very hot &amp; good. I got the grilled chicken sandwich, it was perfectly fine. But nothing too special. My wife got chicken noodle salad with the chicken on the side, as she's a vegetarian. My sister in law got chicken strips. The teenager got burger sliders. <br/><br/>The rating is based on:<br/>3 for food (what you'd expect from a chain like this)<br/>5 for server (Donna) <br/>and <br/>4 atmosphere (lots to look at)<br/><br/>It's one of the better choices for a casual lunch, if you find yourself at the wharf.</span></p>,\n",

I wouldn't recommend ordering from Hard Rock Cafe for delivery if you're looking for a satisfying meal.\",\n",
       " \"Nice spot at Pier 39.There was a bit of a wait, but let me share... there's no room for waiting!  It's connected to their shop, but annoyed me with all the strollers and people blocking the Check-in area.  I do love the items they sell!There's rock music and videos playing!!! Wonderful!!!The food is really good!  The salad was very balanced!  Not watery even with noodles!  The drinks were good... shots cost extra... just get a drink on the rocks and save some money!  :) The servers are attentive and friendly!  Okay... here's the missing star... they don't allow you to select the tip!  18% is added onto the bill, along with other SF taxes.  Not that I'm a cheap tipper, but wow... and of course, I didn't complain, but some information should be posted or at least added to the Menu!!!  Some people need notice before this extreme non-customer service behavior!  Clean restrooms!  Parking garage across the street, which is about $15/4hours.\"]"
